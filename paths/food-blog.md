# Food Blog App

You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind. Follow @Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. 

Your job is to create a food blog application with the following features:
1. User authentication using Firebase Auth
2. Tab navigation to different routes: Home, Profile (for users), Profile (for restaurants to suggest edits to their restaurant as long as their email domain matches the restaurant's domain), Profile (for the owner of the app, who is the one who is creating the blog posts), and Find a Restaurant
3. Filters for rating, cuisine, and location (primarily in the DC metro area)
4. User profiles with customizable information. Users can bookmark, add to lists, and rate restaurants that they see on the app, although the main rating is decided by the owner of the app.
5. Ability to create blog posts with text, videos, and images. Each blog post has a title, star rating out of 100, tags of the cuisine, tags of the location, links to the restaurant across multiple platforms (Website, Google Maps, Yelp, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly twitter)), and a description of the blog post.
6. A home feed to display posts of blog posts in chronological order or filtered by the users' rating, cuisine, and location preferences.
7. bookmark and add to list functionality for posts.
8. Use AI to generate blog posts by searching the web for top restaurants in the DC metro area. If the owner has yet to rate the restaurant, the rating will be TBD and the blog post will be a basic one generated by the AI using the most relevant information found on the web.
9. Implement a search bar where the user can say what they want to eat and the app will return a list of restaurants that match the user's criteria.
10. The App should be responsive to different screen sizes, primarily mobile.

Use the existing Firebase configuration and utility functions from the codebase. Implement the food blog functionality in new page components for the feed, profile, and post creation. Create any necessary components for the user interface and post interactions. Replace any existing code in the codebase to transform it into a food blog application.
